This repo contains two examples of usages of the Pretraining PepLand model. 

- Load the pretrained model and extract the embeddings of the peptides. See more deatils in `main.py` and `test_feature_extractor()` function.
- Create a new model which combines the pretrained model and a new head. See more details in `main.py` and `test_model_predictor()` function.
